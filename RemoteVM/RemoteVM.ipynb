    "- Manage and update firewalls on Linux\n",

    "Showing the full process of installing and creating a VM is outside of the scope of this project, but one key thing I learned in doing this project is to ensure that a VM is using a 'Bridged Adapter' in its network settings. This ensures that the VM is available on the network for communications between machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default setting is to use NAT (Network Address Translation) which allows the virtual machine to access external networks through the host's IP address, while a bridged adapter connects the VM directly to the network, giving it its own IP address on the same network as the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "By changing this setting you will be able to connect to the VM from other machines (see the ping results from the Windows terminal)."
