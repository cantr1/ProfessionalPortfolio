Welcome to my **DevOps journey**! 🚀  
This repository is where I showcase projects that highlight my growth toward becoming a **DevOps Engineer**.  

Right now, this portfolio is **under construction 🏗️**, but my goal is to build several projects that demonstrate my skills across coding, automation, and infrastructure.

## 🔥 Current Project  

### 🪙 **Blockchain Emulator with MQTT Integration**  
- 🐍 Built in **Python**  
- 🔗 Simulates a blockchain with transaction & mining features  
- 📡 Uses **MQTT** for real-time blockchain updates  
- 💻 CLI app for flexible interaction with the chain  
- 🐳 Containerized applications

This project blends **Python development**, **messaging systems**, and **containerization**, showing my ability to work across both software and infrastructure layers.

## 🛠️ Roadmap (Coming Soon)  

Here’s what I’ll be adding next:  

- 🐚 **Bash**: Automation scripts & sysadmin utilities  
- ⚙️ **Ansible**: Infrastructure as Code for provisioning & config mgmt  
- 🦫 **Go**: Cloud-native tools & DevOps utilities  
- 🐳 **Docker / Kubernetes**: Containers, orchestration & scaling  
- 🛡️ **CI/CD & Monitoring**: Pipelines, automation, and observability  

---

## 🎯 Goals  

- ✅ Build high quality projects that show breadth & depth in DevOps  
- ✅ Document each project clearly 📖  
- ✅ Containerize where possible for easy testing 🐋  

This portfolio is an evolving space — stay tuned for more! ✨

## 💡 Notes  

- Each project will include **code**, **docs**, and (where possible) **containerized deployments**.  
- Suggestions & feedback are always welcome 🙌
