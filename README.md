Welcome to my **DevOps journey**! 🚀  
This repository is where I showcase projects that highlight my growth toward becoming a **DevOps Engineer**.  

Right now, this portfolio is **under construction 🏗️**, but my goal is to build several projects that demonstrate my skills across coding, automation, and infrastructure.

## 🔥 Projects  

### 🪙 **Blockchain Emulator with MQTT Integration**  
- 🐍 Built in **Python**  
- 🔗 Simulates a blockchain with transaction & mining features  
- 📡 Uses **MQTT** for real-time blockchain updates  
- 💻 CLI app for flexible interaction with the chain  
- 🐳 Containerized applications

This project blends **Python development**, **messaging systems**, and **containerization**, showing my ability to work across both software and infrastructure layers.  

### 🔨 **Bash Anvil – Automated Server Deployment with Semaphore**  
- 🐚 Built with **Bash** for automation and testing  
- 📦 Integrated with **Semaphore** for CI/CD playbook deployment  
- 🔒 Includes **Linux hardening** and **audit checks**  
- 🧪 Features a custom **Bash testing framework** with color-coded results  
- ⚡ Automates **end-to-end server setup**, from dependencies to monitoring
- 🐍 Built a **Python** script to collect system data and report to **MQTT**     

This project demonstrates my ability to design **repeatable infrastructure automation**, blending  
**scripting, orchestration, and security practices** into a single workflow.

## 🛠️ Roadmap (Coming Soon)  

Here’s what I’ll be adding next:  

- 🦫 **Go**: Cloud-native tools & DevOps utilities  
- 🐳 **Docker / Kubernetes**: Containers, orchestration & scaling   

---

## 🎯 Goals  

- ✅ Build high quality projects that show breadth & depth in DevOps  
- ✅ Document each project clearly 📖  
- ✅ Containerize where possible for easy testing 🐋  

This portfolio is an evolving space — stay tuned for more! ✨  

---

## 💡 Notes  

- Each project will include **code**, **docs**, and (where possible) **containerized deployments**.  
- Suggestions & feedback are always welcome 🙌
