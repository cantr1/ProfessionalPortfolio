# Kelly Cantrell - Professional Portfolio
Welcome to my Professional Portfolio! This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my best data-driven projects, methodologies, and coding expertise. Here, you'll find an overview of various projects I've made throughout my data science journey, from exploratory data analyses to advanced predictive algorithms. 

### California Housing Market Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze the California housing market to identify key factors influencing median home values and predict future housing prices.

**Tools & Methods:**

- **Python:** Utilized Python for data wrangling, analysis, and machine learning, with a focus on the pandas, Matplotlib, and SciKit-Learn libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Crafted new features that capture the complexities of the real estate market, such as proximity to the ocean and household size.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculated correlation coefficients to identify strong predictors of home values, with special attention to median income and geographical location.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Created a RandomForestRegressor model, optimized with grid search and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation to ensure high accuracy and generalizability.
- **Data Visualization:** Generated insightful plots to visualize geographical pricing trends and the impact of income on housing affordability.
- **Model Performance:** Achieved a high mean cross-validation score, indicating a model that is both precise and robust in its predictive capabilities.
