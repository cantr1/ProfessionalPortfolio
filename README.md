## Projects 
### California Housing Market Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze the California housing market to identify key factors influencing median home values and predict future housing prices.

**Tools & Methods:**

- **Python:** Utilized Python for data wrangling, analysis, and machine learning, with a focus on the pandas, Matplotlib, and SciKit-Learn libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Crafted new features that capture the complexities of the real estate market, such as proximity to the ocean and household size.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculated correlation coefficients to identify strong predictors of home values, with special attention to median income and geographical location.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Created a RandomForestRegressor model, optimized with grid search and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation to ensure high accuracy and generalizability.
- **Data Visualization:** Generated insightful plots to visualize geographical pricing trends and the impact of income on housing affordability.
- **Model Performance:** Achieved a high mean cross-validation score, indicating a model that is both precise and robust in its predictive capabilities.

### Repair Logging Assistant

**Objective:** Develop a Python-based tool to aid new technicians in creating systematic and informative repair logs, simplifying the technical documentation process.

**Tools & Methods:**

- **Python Development:** Utilized Python to build the application, with an emphasis on readability and functionality.
- **User Experience Design:** Crafted a user-friendly interface to accommodate technicians with varying levels of expertise.
- **OOP Design:** Employed Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure the system's scalability and maintainability.
- **Logging Mechanism:** Implemented a logging feature for a comprehensive repair history documentation.
- **Search Capabilities:** Integrated query functionality for retrieval of logs using serial numbers.

### Password Manager 
**Objective:** A python project aimed at creating a password management system inline with standard security practices.

**Tools & Methods:**

  - **SHA-256 Hashing:** Utilizes SHA-256, the standard for modern cybersecurity, to hash both usernames and passwords.
  - **Enhanced Security:** Hashing both usernames and passwords to protect user credentials.
  - **User Management:** Allows for user creation, login, password verification, and password change.
  - **User-Friendly Interface:** Command-line interface for simplicity and ease of use.

**Project Versions:** This repository contains two versions of the project:

  - **Simple Project:** Designed for those unfamiliar with coding, this version offers a straightforward implementation to demonstrate basic concepts.
  - **Complex Project:** A more advanced version ready for actual implementation, showcasing robust security practices and additional features.
