    "Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, involves simulating real-world attacks on a target system to identify vulnerabilities and assess security measures. In this notebook, we will walk through a basic penetration test workflow, highlighting key steps and techniques used to discover and exploit a vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will focus on a scenario where we find an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port on a target system. RDP is a protocol used for remote access to Windows machines, and an open port can sometimes indicate a potential security risk. By leveraging this vulnerability, we will demonstrate how an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the target machine.\n",
