   Connect Semaphore to your Ansible playbook repository (e.g., GitHub or local Git server).

4. **Add a Key Store**  
   Store SSH keys or credentials. For local testing, add your SSH key here.

5. **Set Up Inventory**  
   Define your target hosts using a static inventory (YAML/INI) or dynamic source.

6. **Create a Task**  
   - Choose **Ansible Playbook** as the task type.  
   - Select your repo, playbook, and inventory.

## 4. Deploy!
