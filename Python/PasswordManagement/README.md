# InfoSec Password Encryption Project
## Overview

In response to the increasing number of data breaches affecting millions of users, this project aims to enhance user authentication processes using robust cryptographic practices. This Python-based project focuses on implementing strong password encryption methods to ensure user data security and integrity.
## Key Features
- Hashing Passwords

    SHA-256 Hashing: Utilizes Python's hashlib library to hash passwords, ensuring that they are stored in a secure, undecipherable format. This protects the passwords even in the event of a data breach.

- Secure Password Input

    Getpass Integration: Implements getpass, a Python library that hides password input on the command line, preventing passwords from being displayed in plain text and reducing the risk of shoulder-surfing attacks.

- Implementation

    This project includes two code samples. The first sample provides an overview of how the libraries are used in a general sense while the second code sample shows the implementation of the code in a software application I created for my current workplace.

## Why It Matters

Password hashing and secure input are not merely featuresâ€”they are essential components of a commitment to security by design. Implementing these techniques protects sensitive information and aligns with best practices in cybersecurity, safeguarding our users.
