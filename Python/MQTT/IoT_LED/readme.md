This project builds on the principles of the chat room to implement a simple LED function on a Raspberry Pi with MQTT.

The script subscribes to a topic from the broker and listens for certain cues:
- ON: turns on the LED
- OFF: turns off the LED
- BLINK: blinks the LED ten times

Example of the script in action:

And the effect in the real world!
