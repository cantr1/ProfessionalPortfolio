    "In this project, we will explore the use of Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic with the goal of extracting images transmitted over the network. In our hypothetical, we recieved a ticket suggesting that there is suspicious network traffic on a machine in our network. After remoting into the machine, we utilize the Wireshark tool to examine this suspicios traffic.\n",

    "Wireshark is a powerful open-source network protocol analyzer that allows users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. It provides visibility into the detailed operations of network protocols, which makes it an invaluable tool for network troubleshooting, security analysis, and data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will demonstrate how to identify and isolate image files transmitted via HTML and FTP protocols by analyzing captured network packets. By examining these packets, we can extract and reconstruct the images, offering a practical example of how Wireshark can be utilized for network forensic purposes."

    "HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It serves as the backbone of most websites, structuring content like text, images, links, and other multimedia elements to be displayed in web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML works by using a system of tags that define various elements on a webpage. These tags, enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <img> for images), tell the browser how to display the content. HTML is a markup language, meaning it annotates text with information that the browser interprets to render the content correctly.\n",

    "When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to a web server, which then responds with an HTML file. The browser reads this HTML file and renders the content, including text, images, and other elements, as a visually coherent webpage. Images in HTML are typically embedded using the <img> tag, which references the image's URL.\n",
