README for Heart Disease Data Analysis Project

Project Introduction

This project takes a deep dive into the analysis of heart disease, aiming to uncover key factors that contribute to heart health. Using a dataset that includes various medical attributes of patients, we've applied statistical and data visualization techniques to identify significant predictive factors for heart disease.

Highlights of the Analysis

    Predictive Factors: The analysis has pinpointed critical variables such as 
    the number of major vessels ('ca'), the slope of the ST segment ('slope'), 
    exercise-induced angina ('exang'), types of chest pain ('cp'), 
    along with patient 'age' and 'sex'. 
    These factors play a pivotal role in assessing the risk of heart disease.

    Data Visualization: I've employed Python and its libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn 
    to create a suite of visualizations. These range from histograms to complex correlation heatmaps, 
    offering a visual exploration of the data and facilitating an understanding 
    of the intricate relationships between different health indicators.

    Prevalence of Heart Disease: My findings indicate that in the sampled data, 
    55% of the patients are affected by heart disease. This significant proportion highlights 
    the critical nature of the issue and the need for focused preventive healthcare measures.

    Machine Learning Model: Created a machine learning model with SKLearn that was shown to have 87% accuracy in predicting
    heart disease.
    

Project Aim

The project is tailored to:

    Healthcare professionals seeking data-driven insights into heart disease.
    
    Data scientists and analysts looking to understand the application of Python in medical data analysis.
    
    Public health authorities interested in the prevalence and risk factors of heart disease.

Data Analysis Process

    Initial Data Exploration: Using descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's basic characteristics.
    
    Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring data quality and suitability for in-depth analysis.
    
    Statistical Analysis: Identifying key factors that are predictive of heart disease.
    
    Visualization: Creating a range of visuals to represent the data effectively.

    Modeling: Created a RandomForestClassifier that achieved 87% accuracy of predictions.

Tools Used

    Python: The programming language of choice for data processing and analysis.
    
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries used for creating visualizations.

    SKLearn: Python library for predictive machine learning models.
